		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		Templates can be used to produce the content of a textual response, most important
		the content of a HTML response. 
		<p>
		Let's suppose we are in a {javadoc:controller.Controller} method, evaluated the request and gathered all data needed 
		for the response. In case of a pure data response like a JSON message we can just rely on 
		methods like {javadoc:response.Response#writeJson(java*lang*Object) Response.writeJson} to produce the response content.
		Easy.<br>But in case of HTML output more needs to be done.       
		<p>
		The {javadoc:response.Response#getContentWriter() Response} class itself offers a {javadoc:template.TemplateWriter} to which we can directly
		write the content, in a series of <code>print</code> calls. But this approach only works for really simple content. 
		Templates to the rescue!
		<p>
		Templates are a way to describe the static scaffold of a document or content. Dynamic
		data is intermingled into this scaffold to produce the actual output. The syntax of templates 
		is defined by a template system. These systems also often have a runtime component 
		&ndash; a template engine &ndash; which, given the data, interprets the template syntax and produces the output.
		<p>
		Civilian uses the {javadoc:template.Template} class to represent template instances. In the following section we
		describe the architectural implications of this class and how to use it.  
		<p>
		
		<h2 id="template">The Template class</h2>
		Templates are represented as objects of class {javadoc:template.Template}. The Template base class itself is abstract and agnostic
		of the template system used.
		<p>
		Once you have a constructed template, it is is easy to write it to the response:
			
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>Template template = ...<br
			>Response response = ...<br
			>response.writeTemplate(template);     // 1) calls 2)<br
			>// or<br
			>template.print(response.getWriter()); // 2)</code></pre>
		</div>	
		In order to print its content, a template object must hold all dynamic data needed to produce the content.
		The typical work done in a {javadoc:controller.Controller} method when processing a request, therefore consists of these steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Evaluate request parameters
			<li>Gather all required data to produce the response
			<li>Create a template object, passing all needed data
			<li>Write the template to the response
		</ol>
		
		Like controllers, template objects are constructed to produce a single response and are not reused between different requests.
		<p>
		The self-contained nature of templates has an important architectural implication.
		Template objects can itself be passed to other templates. That allows to build complex response content
		by composing it from simpler parts. 
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>Template menuTemplate    = ...<br>Template contentTemplate = ...<br>Template pageTemplate    = new PageTemplate(menuTemplate, contentTemplate);<br>response.writeTemplate(pageTemplate);</code></pre>
		</div>	
		
		<h2 id="fmvel">Integration of Freemarker and Velocity</h2>
		{link:http://freemarker.org/ Freemarker} and {link:https://velocity.apache.org/ Velocity}
		are well-established template systems.
		<p>
		Both libraries provide own template classes. Given a Freemarker or Velocity template object you can easily produce response content
		by writing the template to the {javadoc:template.TemplateWriter} of the response. 
		<p>
		To turn a Freemarker or Velocity template into a Civilian template you can additionally use 
		{javadoc:template.FreemarkerTemplate} and {javadoc:template.VelocityTemplate}. They are simple wrappers for their native
		counterpart and constructed given a Freemarker or a Velocity template object plus their respective data models.<br>
		<p>
		Integration of other template systems would follow the same pattern.      
		<p> 
		 
		<h2 id="csp">CSP Template Engine</h2>
		Civilian offers an own template system called CSP which stands for Civilian Server Pages. 
		CSP is described in detail in the <a href="doc-templates-csp.html">next chapter</a>.
