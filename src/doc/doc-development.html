		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		This chapter deals with development topics.
		<p>
		First we concentrate on ease of development.<br>
		We want to work with frameworks that support an elegant, fast and productive development mode.<br>
		Children would break out in tears if you would tell them about past J2EE application servers 
		with 10++ minutes redeployment time just to see the effect of changing a single line of code.<br>
		Much has improved since, but there is still room for more. Here we describe several techniques to ease development. 
		We especially describe Civilians class-reloading technique which can supercharge your development cycle. 
		<p>
		Then we discuss how Civilian web applications can be tested, introduce the admin application and
		end with a topic which is at the very beginning of application development: Scaffold new applications.

		<h2 id="ease">Ease of development</h2>
		From a developers perspective we want to see the effect of code changes immediately. Ideally we want just
		to hit refresh in the browser. PHP is not an option since we are Java pigheads.
		
		<h3 id="tomcat-loader">Using Tomcats VirtualWebappLoader</h3>
		For deployment in a servlet container you can always build a WAR archive of your application and deploy that.<br>
		Eclipse Dynamic Web Projects (and similar offers by other IDEs) do the packing and copying for you.
		<p>
		When using {link:https://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat} (7.0.54+) we take the opposite
		approach: Instead of deploying the application into Tomcats webapp directory, we instruct Tomcat to pick up
		the application from our IDE project, using Tomcats 
		{link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/loader/VirtualWebappLoader.html VirtualWebappLoader}.
		(In Tomcat 8 configuration seems to have {link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/resources.html changed}).  
		<p>
		In <code>$tomcat/conf/server.xml</code> add a context entry for your application within the <code>Host</code> element:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>&lt;Host name="localhost" ...>
    ...
    &lt;Context path="<b>/myapp</b>" docBase="<b>c:\proj\myproj\web</b>">
        &lt;Loader className="org.apache.catalina.loader.VirtualWebappLoader" virtualClasspath="<b>
            c:\proj\base\bin;
            c:\proj\base\lib\*.jar;
            c:\proj\myproj\lib\*.jar;
            c:\proj\myproj\bin</b>"/>
            &lt;!-- jars in c:\proj\myproj\web\WEB-IN\lib ate automatically included --&gt;
    &lt;/Context><br>&lt;Host></code></pre></div>
		<code>Context/@path</code> is the path of the ServletContext within Tomcat, <code>Context/@docBase</code> is the web applications root directory
		(containing the <code>WEB-INF</code> folder), <code>Context/Loader/@virtualClasspath</code> instructs Tomcat where to find your classes and libraries.
		<p>
		If you now start up Tomcat, it will serve your application without a deployment in its <code>webapp</code> folder.     
		       
		<h3 id="tomcat-manager">Using Tomcat manager to reload applications</h3>
		Some servlet containers are able to monitor application files and reload the application when they detect a change.<br>
		Using Tomcats manager application we can also reload applications but can precisely control when to do it.
		Please follow these {link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/manager-howto.html instructions}
		to enable Tomcats manager application on your development box and especially install a user whose role includes the <code>manager-script</code> role.
		<p>
		With that you can reload an application by sending its context path to the manager app: 
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>http://localhost/manager/text/reload?path=<b>/myapp</b></code></pre>
		</div>   
		This is how we use this feature:<br> 
		When running in development mode we typically integrate a reload button or link in our HTML pages. When clicked it will 
		send an Ajax call to the manager application
		Please take a look at the <a href="doc-samples.html#crm">CRM sample</a> and the script <code>civassets/dev/reload-tomcat.js</code>
		in Civilians source how this can be implemented.
		<p>
		Now we can write and save code in our IDE, switch to the browser, click the reload button and immediately see the effect.<br>
		Note that this technique will reinitialize your application. If the application needs significant startup time, 
		this will somewhat degrade the reload experience...
		
		<h3 id="embed">Running an embedded Jetty or Tomcat server</h3>
		Another great way to avoid building WARs or copy classes to a servlet container is to start an embedded server.<br> 
		The {javadoc:boot.Jetty} and {javadoc:boot.Tomcat} classes provide a small command line interface to start a Jetty or Tomcat server embedded
		in your program (see the <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart</a> for an example).<br>
		(The {javadoc:boot.Tomcat} class right now is experimental &ndash; unfortunately Tomcats documentation 
		about its embedded mode is not very detailed).

		<h2 id="reload">Class reloading</h2>
		Civilians class reloading is a feature which when used in combination with the <a href="#tomcat-loader">VirtualWebappLoader</a> technique
		or with an embedded server enables the following development cycle:
		<ol>
		<li>Code (save, compile).
		<li>Hit refresh in the browser and immediately see the changes.
		</ol>
		Unlike <a href="#tomcat-manager">application reloading</a> this does not reinitialize the application, so you now will
		see the changes without any delay.
		<p>
		When class reloading is turned on, Civilian is using a new classloader for each request to load your controller class and all 
		classes used by the controller. Therefore on the next request you will see code changes immediately since now the new controller
		version is loaded and used.
		<p>
		To turn class reloading on, you need to add these configuration entries to your <code>civilian.ini</code> config file: 
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code># turn on development mode<br><b>develop = true</b><br><br># in your app config add this<br><b>app.myapp.dev.classreload = true</b></code></pre>
		</div>   
		Class reloading can pick up any changes in all classes which were not touched during application startup. This usually includes controllers, templates, forms etc.
		By default only classes below the application class are included. With the <code>.exclude</code> and <code>.include</code> switches
		you can fine-tune what classes are reloadable:     
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code><b>app.myapp.dev.classreload.exclude = org.myapp.web.SessionUser,org.myapp.web.Constants<br>app.myapp.dev.classreload.include = org.myapp.util.*<br></b></code></pre>
		</div>
		If you create a new controller, you need to restart the application to see the changes.
		<p>
		Sometimes class reloading may not work as desired. In this case you can set the <a href="doc-config.html#logging">log level</a> of <code>org.civilian.classloader</code>
		to <code>trace</code> to analyze if classes are loaded correctly.   
		
		<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
		Civilian allows to run requests and evaluate responses in a test environment without the overhead of HTTP calls or the need to start a servlet server.<br>
		Therefore it provides the {javadoc:server.test.TestServer} class which implements {javadoc:server.Server}.   
		The {javadoc:server/test/package-summary context.test} package contains a {javadoc:server.Server} implementation which can be used for unit tests.
		The steps to run test request are:
		<ol>
		<li>Create a {javadoc:server.test.TestServer} instance.
		<li>Either initialize the server using a <code>civilina.ini</code> config, or explicitly add application objects to the TestServer.
		<li>Create a {javadoc:server.test.TestRequest} object and set its properties.
		<li>Run the request and assert that the returned {javadoc:server.test.TestResponse} matches the expectations.   
		</ol>
		The <a href="doc-samples.html#test">Test sample</a> demonstrates this technique.
		
		<h2 id="admin">Admin app</h2> 
		Civilian ships with a built-in admin application.
		Its gives you an overview of deployed applications, their configurations and resource URLs. It shows 
		if your configurations work as expected, and which resource URLs are actually published. You can also inspect which controller
		is mapped to a resource and what action methods are available.
		<p>  
		The admin app uses Civilians ability to run multiple {javadoc:application.Application applications} in a Civilian {javadoc:server.Server server}.
		When you start your application in development mode by default the admin app is also started and available under the path <code>/civadmin</code> below
		your context path.
		<p>
		The admin app can be configured via <code><a href="doc-config.html#ini">civilian.ini</a></code> like your own applications.
		(It just uses the key prefix <code>civ.admin</code> instead of <code>app.<i>id</i></code>).   

		<h2 id="scaffold">Scaffold</h2> 
		The <a href="quickstart.html">quickstart tutorial</a> already introduced the {javadoc:tool.scaffold.Scaffold} tool 
		to generate a Civilian application. The manifest of <code>civilian.jar</code> declares it as Main-class. 
		It prints a detailed help message when run without any arguments.
		Scaffold expects 
		<ul>
		<li>optional parameters,  		
		<li>the directory where to put the generated files,
		<li>a prefix which will be prependeded to the name of core application classes.
		</ul>
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>java -jar civilian.jar <i>param</i>* <i>directory</i> <i>class-prefix</i></code></pre>
		</div>
		for example
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>java -jar civilian.jar /proj/crm Crm</code></pre>
		</div>
		The parameters are 
		<table class="table table-border">
		<tr>
			<td><code>-eclipse</code>
			<td>also generates Eclipse project files</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-enc <i>encoding</i></code>
			<td>use the encoding for the generated files (default is UTF-8)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-locales <i>list of locales</i></code>
			<td>comma separated list of supported locales (without spaces), default is simple <code>en</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-libs <i>list of jar files</i></code>
			<td>copy the jar files to the generated <code>WEB-INF/lib directory</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-min</code>
