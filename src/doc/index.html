<div class="col-md-12 intro">
	<p class="center">We wanted a small, fast, elegant and complete framework to write web applications,<br>
	&ndash; so we created Civilian.<hr>
	<p>Civilian is a server-side framework to develop web applications.
	It is written in Java (7+) 
	and runs in any servlet (3.0+) container.
	It is <a href="download.html">published</a> as open source and <a href="license.html">free</a> to use.
	<p>Civilian does not teach you how to implement your data back-end.
	And it does not restrict your client design in terms of HTML layout,  
	CSS rules, JavaScript code, Ajax conversations and data representation. It just helps to build a bridge between these ends.</p>
	<p>It supports development of traditional round trip applications but also serves single-page apps 
	based on client-side MVC/MVVM JavaScript frameworks.
	With all the recent advances shown in JavaScript frameworks, we still value the virtues of a robust and efficient server application.
	For that Civilian offers solid support for RESTful resource dispatch and routing, clean URL design, handling of assets, 
	server-side templates, linking, form processing, localization, security and a supercharged development mode.</p>
