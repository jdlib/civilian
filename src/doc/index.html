	<hr>
	<p>Civilian is a server-side framework to develop web applications.
	It is written in Java (11+) 
	and runs in any servlet (3.1+) container.
	It is <a href="download.html">published</a> as open source and <a href="license.html">free</a> to use.
	<p>Civilian does not teach you how to implement your data backend.
	And it does not restrict your client design in terms of HTML layout,  
	CSS rules, JavaScript code, Ajax conversations and data representation. It just helps to build a bridge between these ends.</p>
	<p>It supports development of traditional round trip applications but also serves single-page apps 
	based on client-side MVC/MVVM JavaScript frameworks.
	With all the advances shown in SPA frontends, we still value the virtues of a robust and efficient server application.
	For that Civilian offers solid support for RESTful resource dispatch and routing, clean URL design, handling of assets, 
	server-side templates, linking, form processing, localization, security and a supercharged development mode.</p>
