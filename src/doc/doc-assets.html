		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		Assets are static resources like CSS stylesheets, JavaScript code, images, etc. 
		used by your application. They are resources since they can be addressed by a URL;
		they are static since they are (usually) not generated at runtime, but reside as files in the local file system.<br>
		
		<h2 id="processing">Processing asset requests</h2>
		a client does not care if a resource is static or dynamic. But internally processing of these requests is different:
		<ul>
		<li>Requests for dynamic resources requires to create a Controller and call it to process the request.
		<li>Requests for static resources will return the content of a server-side file.
		</ul>
		By default Civilian first tries to route a request to a Controller.
		If not possible it tries to find an asset for the request. If both fails the application sends
		{javadoc:Application#createNotFoundResponse() a not-found response}.
		<p>
		Asset responses include a <code>Last-Modified</code> header for the asset file date, and a <code>max-age</code>
		header for 30 days. The <code>If-Modified-Since</code> request header is evaluated and may
		result in a {javadoc:response.Response*Status#SC304_NOT_MODIFIED 304 not modified} response. 
		
		<h2 id="locations">Asset locations</h2>
		Civilians asset handling allows you to publish files from a local directories or (any other file trees) as
		resources under the application path.<br>  
		For example if directory <code>c:\myfiles</code> is published under the asset path <code>/files</code> in an application
		with {javadoc:Application#getPath() path} <code>/myapp</code>, then the directory content will become available
		as resources:
		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr>
			<th width="50%">File</th>
			<th>Resource</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>c:\myfiles\<b>style.css</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/myapp/<b>files/style.css</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>c:\myfiles\<b>js\script.js</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/myapp/<b>files/js/script.js</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		(Of course the asset path may be the root path <code>/</code>, publishing the asset files directly under the application root).
		<p>
		
		<h3 id="dir">Publishing file assets from local directories</h3>
		If deployed in a servlet container a Civilian has the directory layout of a web application, i.e. consists of a root 
		web app directory, containing a <code>WEB-INF</code> subdirectory with <code>web.xml</code> <code>civilian.ini</code>.
		<p>
		The most natural way to publish assets is to place their files in the web app directory (the Civilian runtime makes
		sure that files from the WEB-INF folder are not accesible).
		<p>
		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr>
			<th width="50%">File</th>
			<th>Resource</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/<b>style.css</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/myapp/<b>style.css</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/<b>js/script.js</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/myapp/<b>js/script.js</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/<b>WEB-INF/web.xml</b></code></td>
			<td><code>403 forbidden</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		You may also publish a subdirectory of the web app root, or any directory in the local file system, outside of your
		web app structure. (The later feature comes in handy during development, when you want to skip a
		<a href="doc-development.html#tomcat-loader">deployment build</a>). 

		<h3 id="classpath">Publishing Java resource files from the classpath</h3>
		Java classpath resources can also be published as web resources. For security reasons only Java resources with certain
		non-empty prefixes may be published.<br>
		If for example Java resources beginning with <code>"/civassets"</code> are published under the asset path <code>/civ</code> 
		in an application with path <code>/myapp</code>, then these Java resources become available as web resources: 

		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr>
			<th width="50%">File</th>
			<th>Resource</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>jar:civilian.jar//civassets/<b>admin/admin.css</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/myapp/<b>civ/admin/admin.css</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/WEB-INF/classes/civassets/<b>style.css</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/myapp/<b>civ/style.css</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3 id="impl">Implementing own asset locations</h3>
		Asset locations are represented as instances of the {javadoc:asset.AssetLocation} class. If you need an additional asset retrieval 
		besides directories or Java resources, you could implement your own AssetLocation and install an instance during
		asset configuration (see below). 

		<h2 id="caching">Caching</h2>
		Civilian maintains an asset cache and keeps smaller assets in memory to allow for fast responses.
		(It also monitors and detects changes in assets files, and updates the cache accordingly).
		
		<h2 id="service">Asset service</h2>
		All the different asset locations used by an application and the asset cache are organized as pipeline
		and made {javadoc:Application#getAssetService() available} as {javadoc:asset.AssetService}.
		
		<h2 id="encoding">Asset encoding and content-types</h2>
		An asset response contains a <code>Content-Type</code> header which includes an encoding parameter.
		By default encoding of textual assets equals the application {javadoc:Application#getDefaultCharEncoding() encoding} (which by default is UTF-8).
		It is a good idea to serve all HTML pages and textual assets in the same encoding.
		<p>
		Additionally you can specify different encodings for every asset location.
		<p>
		The {javadoc:Server#getContentTypeLookup() ContentLookup} of the context is used to derive content-types from file extensions.
		In a servlet environment this is implemented with a call to <code>ServletContext.getMimeType()</code> and therefore uses
		the content-type configuration of the servlet container.     
		 
		<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>
		By default Civilian does not serve any assets. You must explicitly configure the asset locations
		of an application via settings in <a href="doc-config.html#ini">civilian.ini</a>
		or during application setup.
		
		<h3 id="civilian.ini">Configuration in civilian.ini</h3>
		To define a single asset location for an application with id <code>myapp</code>, add a line to <code>civilian.ini</code>
		<div class="highlight">
			<code>app.myapp.asset.location = <i>&lt;definition></i></code>
		</div>
		For multiple locations, add
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>app.myapp.asset.location.0 = <i>&lt;definition 0></i><br
			>app.myapp.asset.location.1 = <i>&lt;definition 1></i><br
			>...</code></pre>
		</div>
		The location definition consists of the location type, an optional parameter and 
		an optional path relative to the application path:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre>&lt;definition> ::= &lt;type> ( '<code>:</code>' &lt;param> )? ( '<code>-></code>' &lt;path> )?<br
			>&lt;type> ::= <code>dir</code> | <code>res</code> | <code>civres</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
		The location type <code>dir</code> denotes a <b>directory</b> containing assets files. If it has no param it equals
		the directory where the application is deployed, if the param is an relative directory
		then it is the corresponding subdirectory, else it is interpreted as absolute directory. 
		<div class="highlight">
			<table width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"></td>
				<td>maps to directory</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>app.myapp.asset.location.0 = dir</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>app.myapp.asset.location.1 = dir:gfx/images</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/gfx/images</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>app.myapp.asset.location.2 = dir:c:\repo\files</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>c:\repo\files</code></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		
		By default the assets are published under the application root path. To <b>publish</b> under a <b>subpath</b>
		add that subpath to the definition:
		<div class="highlight">
			<table width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2">definition / file</td>
				<td width="50%">URL</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2"><code>app.myapp.asset.location.0 = dir</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="20"></td>
				<td><code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/css/style.css</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>https://example.org/myapp/css/style.css</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2"><code>app.myapp.asset.location.0 = dir <b>-> /assets</b></code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="20"></td>
				<td><code>/tomcat/webapps/myapp/css/style.css</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>https://example.org/myapp<b>/assets</b>/css/style.css</code></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		
		The location type <code>res</code> serves <b>Java resources</b> as assets. The required parameter is a 
		non-empty prefix of the served <b>Java resources</b>.<br><code>civres</code> is an abbreviation
		for <code>res:civassets -> /civilian</code> to serve resources from <code>civilian.jar</code>:
		<div class="highlight">
			<table width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"></td>
				<td>maps to resources</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>app.myapp.asset.location.3 = res:assets</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>ClassLoader.getResources("/myassets")</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>app.myapp.asset.location.4 = civres</code></td>
				<td>&rarr; <code>ClassLoader.getResources("/civassets")</code></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3 id="startup">Configuration during application startup</h3>
		Alternatively and additionally you can {javadoc:application.AppConfig#getAssetConfig() configure} the asset 
		locations and cache behaviour during {javadoc:Application#init(org*civilian*application*AppConfig) application startup}.
		<p>
		For advanced use you could also override {javadoc:Application#initAssets(org*civilian*asset*AssetConfig) Application.initAssets(AssetConfig)}
		to determine how the applications {javadoc:asset.AssetService} is constructed.  
		<br>
		  

		<h2 id="build">Build Process</h2>
		JavaScript and CSS assets sent to the browser may often be direct development items. 
		But of course they can also be the result of some build process
		<ul>
		<li>CSS stylesheets can be generated from LESS or SASS files,
		<li>JavaScript can be generated from Coffeescript files,
		<li>JavaScript or stylesheet files can be minified, uglified, beautified, ...
		<li>Multiple JavaScript or stylesheet files can be concatenated
		<li>etc.
		</ul>
		Some web frameworks allow to include such a development process into their asset delivery pipeline.
		This of course eases development: You simply edit the asset source(s) which get automatically transformed 
		into their final form when requested by a client.
		Civilian decided to <b>not include</b> such a facility because of the following reasons.
		<p>
		There are two main scenarios for an asset pipeline with inherent build capabilities:
		<ul>
		<li>Minification and concatenation of multiple sources into a single JavaScript or CSS file
			is typical for a <b>production</b> environment. But usually some build process is already needed  
			to create the deployment artifact (e.g. a WAR file) &ndash; the generation of asset files
			can easily be integrated into that process.
		<li>During <b>development</b> automatic transformation of coffee script, LESS, SASS, etc. files
			into JavaScript or CSS files saves precious development time. But watcher tools   
			like {link:http://gruntjs.com/ Grunt} are just perfect in
			doing this: Just save your source, and the tool will almost immediately generate the transformed file,
			which is then picked up by Civilians asset dispatch on the next request.  
		</ul>
