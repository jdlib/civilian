			<h2 id="webapps">Web applications</h2>
			Most web applications have three parts:
			<ul>
			<li>A <b>client</b> which talks to a server via HTTP. The usual client is the browser,
				technology-wise based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
			<li>A <b>server</b> application which can process HTTP requests and dynamically build responses.
			<li>A <b>database</b> backend which provides data to the server application. 
			</ul>   
			<div class="feature">
				Civilian is a Java framework to develop the server-side part of a web application.
			</div>
		</section>

			<h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>
			There is no shortage of web frameworks in all languages to build
			the server- or client-side of web applications.
			Of course the reason to use a  framework is because it helps to get things done.<br> 
			Frameworks &ndash; in contrast to simple libraries &ndash; often prescribe a very specific way 
			how to structure and implement an application.<br>
			But a framework <i>can</i> become problematic if at some point it prevents you to do something what you want to do.
			Difficult workarounds then often eliminate the gains achieved by using the framework in the first place.<br>
			<div class="feature">
				Civilian does structure your application. But its also wants you to totally control the HTTP response and the data backend
				without any restrictions. Design your application in terms
				of REST API, HTML and data output, Ajax communications and database backend, then use
				Civilian to implement the design.   
			</div>
		</section>
			
		<section>
			<h2 id="rest">REST and clean URLs</h2>
			Todays best practice recommends that a web application should 
			process requests in a {link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer RESTful} 
			way. And the URLs exposed by an application should follow the paradigm of 
			{link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL semantic} or clean URLs.
			
 			<div class="feature">
 				Civilian makes it easy to implement RESTful processing and design clean URLs.  
			</div>
  		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="interactions">Interactions and tasks</h2>

			Web applications must support a variety of clients: Talking with browsers they need to
			deliver HTML pages and assets likes CSS, images, script files. Content can be presented
			in multiple languages or locales. Data-oriented clients will send or consume data formatted as JSON, XML, etc. 
			Recent client-side MVC JavaScript frameworks embody more than one role: They request initial pages or 
			page templates from the server, and then use Ajax calls to obtain or send pure data.
			And it is still valid to develop traditional round trip applications. 
			
			<div class="feature">
				Civilian supports all these web application aspects: Generation of HTML using templates.
				Content serialization of data in different formats. Processing of traditional HTML forms.
				Support for multiple languages and locales. Serving of static assets.
				And it integrates all in an efficient API.     
			</div>
  		</section>
  		
		<section>
			<h2 id="dev">Ease of development</h2>
  			At minimum a framework must allow to implement an application, hopefully without too many obstacles.
  			But we really like frameworks when they are easy and fun to use.
  			
  			<div class="feature">
  				We hope that you won't have a steep learning curve when using Civilian.
  				The API is small, as is the footprint of the library.
  				It contains some neat techniques to boost productivity.
				It does not use <span class="monospace">AbstractProxyFactoryConfigurers</span>.
				You may also enjoy to take a look at the handcrafted source code.
				So we hope you like it.
