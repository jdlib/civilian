			A Civilian application has the directory layout of a servlet application. Its

		This chapter describes how to organize a Civilian application. First we describe
		the directory layout of an application, then the Java class structure.
	  	
		<h2 id="layout">Directory layout</h2>
		A Civilian deployment consists of the application classes, third-party libraries (e.g.
		<code>civilian.jar</code>), configuration files and asset files such as CSS, Javascript, images, etc.<p>
		Civilians primary (and right now only) runtime environment is a servlet container, therefore  
		the directory layout of the application is that of a 
		{link:http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/packaging003.htm servlet application}.<br>
		Its <code>WEB-INF</code> directory contains a 
		<code>web.xml</code> file and a configuration file <code>civilian.ini</code>. Both are described in the
		<a href="doc-config.html">configuration</a> chapter.
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<td width="50%"><code>$web</code></td>
			<td>(static assets)</td>
		</tr>	 
		<tr>
			<td><code>$web/WEB-INF</code></td>
			<td>configuration directory</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$web/WEB-INF/web.xml</code></td>
			<td>servlet configuration</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$web/WEB-INF/civilian.ini</code></td>
			<td>Civilian config file</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$web/WEB-INF/classes</code></td>
			<td>classes, Java resources</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$web/WEB-INF/lib</code></td>
			<td>libraries</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		  
		To deploy to a servlet container your build process must be able to produce a WAR file with these directory layout.
		<p>
		During development we usually embed that structure into a IDE project.
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<td width="50%"><code>$project</code></td>
			<td>project root dir</td>
		</tr>	 
		<tr>
			<td><code>$project/bin</code></td>
			<td>compiled application classes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$project/src</code></td>
			<td>application sources</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$project/lib</code></td>
			<td>third-party libraries</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$project/web</code></td>
			<td>corresponds to $web in the previous table</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>$project/web/WEB-INF</code></td>
			<td>same as the WEB-INF directory in the previous table</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		The <a href="doc-development.html">development</a> chapter describes techniques
		how to run the application directly from such a project structure, for example using
		embedded web servers or Tomcats VirtualWebappLoader, without building a WAR and 
		deploying to a server. 		

		
		<h2 id="classes">Package structure</h2>
		Each Civilian application has an application class derived from {javadoc:Application}.
		You can freely choose its package and name:<br>
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>org.example.petshop.web.PetshopApp</code></pre>
		</div>
		
		If your application uses <a href="doc-resources.html#pathparams">path parameters</a>
		they will be defined as constants in a separate class. Optionally you can create a class
		which defines constants for every resource URL exposed by your application.
		By convention we use the suffixes "PathParams", "Resources" for these classes and place
		it in the application package: 
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>org.example.petshop.web.PetshopPathParams<br
			          >org.example.petshop.web.PetshopResources</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
		As will be described <a href="doc-controllers.html">later</a>, you need to implement
		a {javadoc:Controller} class for each dynamic resource of your application. 
		Their class names and package structure are used to derive their resource URLs,
		so designing your resource URLS will automatically structure your controller classes 
		and packages.<br> 
		The name of the root package of your controller classes must be known to the application
		base class. By default it equals the application package, else you must explicitly
		register it by passing  to the Application constructor.
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>org.example.petshop.web.LoginController       &rarr; /login<br
			          >org.example.petshop.web.food.OrderController  &rarr; /food/order</code></pre>
		</div>
		Controller classes may have helper classes to process their resource. We usually put them
		into the controller package and use naming conventions to express that they form a functional group:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>org.example.petshop.web.food.OrderController<br
			          >org.example.petshop.web.food.OrderForm<br
			          >org.example.petshop.web.food.OrderTemplate</code></pre>
		</div>
		Your application may define any other packages, for instance for accessing the data back-end.
		Keeping those separate from the controller packages is a good idea:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>org.example.petshop.service<br
			          >org.example.petshop.text</code></pre>
		</div>
	
		
		<h2 id="tasks">Main development tasks</h2>
		Developing a Civilian application has these main tasks.
		<ul>
		<li>Design the URL interface of your application, including parameters, allowed REST methods and content types, etc.
		<li>Design the expected responses when calling these URLs.
		<li><a href="doc-development.html#scaffold">Scaffold</a> a new application.
		<li>Configure the application via the Civilian <a href="doc-config.html#ini">config file</a>. 
		<li>Implement an {javadoc:Application} class to
			<ul>
			<li>define all path parameters used by the application
			<li>implement additional programmatic configurations
			<li>initialize and provide application global resources like data back-end services.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Create {javadoc:Controller} implementations for every dynamic resource exposed by the application.
			Controllers most probably will rely on a data back-end services to retrieve model, completely in control by your application.
		<li>Implement {javadoc:template.Template Templates} to be used by controllers to turn models into views.
		<li>Implement {javadoc:form.Form Forms} to be used by controller to read and write HTML forms. 
		<li>Assemble and organize static assets like JavaScript, CSS, image files, etc.
		<li>Take care of application <a href="doc-security.html">security</a>.
		<li>Enjoy rapid development using special Civilian <a href="doc-development.html#reload">development features</a>.
		</ul>
