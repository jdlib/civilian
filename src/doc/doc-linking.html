		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		
		Web applications sometimes need to create URLs to reference application resources: Hyperlinks
		in HTML responses, redirects, HATEOS locations etc. To represent URLs as strings &ndash; 
		as it is usually done &ndash; and manually build URLs is tedious and error prone.
		Just think of formatting of parameter values.   
		<p>
		Hyperlinks on the web can break, but at least they work good enough to be useful.<br> 
		Being realistic about the web does not mean that we tolerate broken links within
		our applications. But using URL strings again makes broken links more likely:
		A change to the URL structure of an application requires to manually look for affected places in the code. 
		<p>
		Civilians {javadoc:resource.Path} and {javadoc:resource.Url} classes help to avoid these pitfalls:
		
		<h2 id="path">The Path class</h2>
		The {javadoc:resource.Path} class provides a normed representation of path strings:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>The root path is represented as empty string <code>""</code>
		<li>Any other path always starts with a <code>'/'</code> but never ends with a <code>'/'</code> character.
		</ul> 
		The Path class supports common operations like adding two paths.<br>
		Many core objects like {javadoc:Server}, {javadoc:Application}, {javadoc:Request}, 
		{javadoc:Resource} etc. are associated with an absolute path from the server root and 
		a relative path with regard to some parent context. They implement the interface
		{javadoc:provider.PathProvider} to give access to these paths.		
		
		<h2 id="url">The Url class</h2>
		The {javadoc:resource.Url} class is a builder class to construct URL strings and  
		guarantees a syntactical correct form of the URL.
		<p>
		To create a Url object you need to call a Url constructor, passing the request object (or a {javadoc:provider.RequestProvider} like
		a {javadoc:Controller}) and an additional argument which describe the URL path:
		<ul>
		<li>or a simple URL or path string, in case you want to address resources outside of the application (or address interal resources
			in an unchecked way). 
		<li>a {javadoc:resource.Path} to build an Url for that path
		<li>a {javadoc:provider.PathProvider} like the {javadoc:Application} or the {javadoc:Request} 
			to build an Url for the {javadoc:provider.PathProvider#getPath() path} of that provider.   
		<li>a {javadoc:Controller} class to build a URL to the resource which is processed by that Controller.   
		<li>a {javadoc:Resource} to build a URL to that resource.   
		</ul>
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>RequestProvider rp = ...<br
			>Url url;<br
			>url = new Url(rp, "https://example.org/some/path");<br
			>url = new Url(rp, getApplication());<br
			>url = new Url(rp, SearchController.class);</code></pre>
		</div>
		
		Once constructed a Url object can be tweaked in many ways:
		<ul>
			<li>Add or change query parameters in a type-safe way
			<li>Add additional path segments or a fragment identifier
		</ul>
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>Url url = ...<br
			>url.addQueryParam("page", 5);<br
			>url.setFragment("details");</code></pre> 
		</div>
		
		To retrieve the URL string simply call {javadoc:resource.Url#toString()}. Behind the scenes this method does some automatic magic:
		<ul>
			<li>Percent encoding of parameters is automatically applied.
			<li>It inserts a session id into the URL if the client does not accept session cookies.
				(You can also {javadoc:resource.Url#addSessionId(boolean) turn of} this automation). 
		</ul>
		
		If the Url is constructed from a Controller class or Resource object (see next chapter), 
		it is easy to detect broken links. For example, delete a Controller class, and the compiler will tell you where is was
		used to build an Url.<br>    
		When constructed in such a way, the Url also knows about path parameters in the URL string and allows you to fill in values for them. 
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>Url url = new Url(rp, MasterDataController.class);<br
			>url.setPathParam(CrmPathParams.CUSTOMERID, 123);</code></pre>
		</div>
		
		<h2 id="resconsts">Use resource constants to create Urls</h2>
		
		At runtime Civilian {javadoc:Application#getRootResource() knows} all the dynamic resources exposed by an application,
		the <a href="doc-resources.html#pathparams">path parameters</a> which are 
		part of the path schemes of the resources, and which {javadoc:Controller controller} processes requests for a resource.<br>
		This knowledge allows Civilian to associate a resource with a request and dispatch the request to its controller.<br>
		<p>
		Normally this resource tree is built at application startup, by <a href="doc-resources.html#basemapping">scanning</a>
		the classpath for the applications controller classes.
		<p>
		But Civilian also allows you to generate a special Java class from the resource tree, which defines
		a Java constant of type {javadoc:Resource} for every dynamic resource in the application.
		An Url to a resource can now also be built by using that constant, as alternative to passing
		the corresponding controller class.
		<p>
		Again, change your resource tree, then regenerate the constants interface, and the compiler
		will tell you all places in your code which need adjustments. 
		Broken links, no more.  
		
		<h3 id="use">Example use of Resource constants</h3>
		<p>
		In the <a href="doc-samples.html#crm">CRM sample</a> we generated interface {source:org.civilian.samples.crm.web.CrmResources}
		which defines constants for all resources of the CRM application.
		To build a {javadoc:resource.Url} to resource <code>/customers/{customerId}/masterdata</code>, 
		we write
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>Url url = new Url(CrmResources.root.customers.$customerId.masterdata);<br>...<br>String s = url.toString(); // at the end convert to a string to be used in the template</code></pre>
		</div>

		<h3 id="generator">The Resource constants generator</h3>
		{javadoc:tool.resource.ServerConstGenerator org.civilian.tool.resource.ServerConstGenerator} is the tool to generate the constants interface.

		It prints a detailed help message when run without any arguments.
		ServerConstGenerator expects the name of your application class and optional parameters:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>java org.civilian.tool.resource.ServerConstGenerator <i>param</i>* <i>app-class</i></code></pre>
		</div>
	
		One of the <code>-out:*</code> parameters must be used to the determine the location of the generated file:<br>
		<code>-out:package &lt;directory></code> writes the output file into the package directory below the given package root directory 
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>... -out:package src/main/generated ...</code></pre>
		</div>
		<code>-out:dir &lt;directory></code> writes the output file into the given directory.<br> 
		<code>-out:file &lt;file></code> writes the output file to the given file.<br> 
		
		The <code>-name</code> parameter sets the name of the generated interface. By default a name is derived from
		the name of the application class. If the name is a simple name, it is qualified package of the application class.
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>... -name MyResources ...</code></pre>
		</div>
		
		The <code>-enc</code> parameter sets the encoding of the generated file. By default the encoding is UTF-8.
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>... -enc ISO-8859-1 ...</code></pre>
		</div>
		
		The <code>-v</code> parameter turns on verbose messages, the <code>-ts</code> parameter causes a timestamp
		to be written into the generated file.
		
		<h3 id="scan">Avoid the classpath scan at application start</h3>
		When Civilian starts an application, it scans the classpath to find the applications {javadoc:Controller} classes
		and then constructs the resource tree. The resource constants interface does contain the exact same information
		and can be used to avoid the scan. Just register during {javadoc:Application#init(org*civilian*application*AppConfig) app initialization}:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>public class MyApp extends Application {
    ...
    protected void init(AppConfig config) {
        ...
        config.setResourceRoot(MyResources.root);
    }
}</code></pre></div>
		But remember to regenerate the resource constants interface when you change the resource tree.
		Another idea might be to only explicitly set the resource root in production mode.       
		
		<h2 id="client">Client-side linking</h2>
		
		The techniques described so far are available on the server.
		But suppose we write a client program to access server resources. Again we don't want to build URLs out of
		error prone strings.<br>
		Since the {javadoc:Resource} and {javadoc:resource.Url} classes are bound to a server-side execution context we cannot
		use them directly. 
		Instead Civilian provides the {javadoc:client.WebResource} and {javadoc:client.WebUrl} classes for use in a client
		program.
		<p>
		To obtain a Java interface defining WebResource constants exposed by the application, we use the command-line tool 
		{javadoc:tool.resource.ClientConstGenerator}.
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>java org.civilian.tool.resource.ClientConstGenerator <i>param</i>* <i>app-class</i></code></pre>
		</div>
		Its command-line parameters are similar to that of the server generator. Run the generator without parameters
		to obtain a detailed help message.
		<p>
		The <a href="doc-samples.html#client">client sample</a> demonstrates how to use WebUrl and WebResource.
		<p>
		Right now only a constants interface for a Java client can be generated. 
		We plan to add a similar output for JavaScript in a future release.
