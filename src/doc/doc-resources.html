		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		From a clients perspective a web application consists of resources which are addressed by a URL and 
		can be requested via HTTP.<br>
		Internally, depending on whether the response content is generated at runtime, we talk about <b>dynamic</b> 
		or <b>static</b> resources. Usually we differentiate static from dynamic resources by using the name 
		<a href="doc-assets.html">assets</a>
		for the static kind.          
		<p>
		Then main tasks with regard to resource processing are
		<ul>
		<li>define the URLs of resources which can be requested by a client.
		<li>for every dynamic resource write code to process requests for that resource and dynamically generate responses.
		<li>provide files for all static resources (assets) and expose them via Civilians asset handling.  
		</ul>
		This chapter explains handling of dynamic resources. From now on we will simply call them resources.
		<p>
		Civilian uses the {javadoc:resource.Resource} class to model a resource. At runtime every application 
		{javadoc:application.Application#getRootResource() possesses} a list of all its resources, organized as resource tree.
		The code which processes resource requests is implemented in {javadoc:controller.Controller} classes. In Civilian every resource is 
		associated with (at most) one controller class.
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<th>Resource</th>
			<th>Controller</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Resource("/users")</code></td>
			<td><code>com.myapp.UsersController</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Resource("/messages")</code></td>
			<td><code>com.myapp.MessagesController</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		The <a href="doc-controllers.html">next</a> chapter will explain the inner workings of controllers. Here  
		we describe how the resource tree is defined and how resources are mapped to controller classes. 
		In webapp lingo this is called <b>routing</b>.
		<p>
		Some web frameworks require to <b>explicitly</b> specify the resource paths
		and map them to controller classes/functions/code. This is fine for a small set of resources but tedious 
		for complex applications.<br> 
		Civilian uses a more <b>implicit</b> approach: It scans the controller classes of an application and builds the resource
		tree using naming conventions and annotations within the controllers.
		<p>   
		Before we explain how this works we complicate things a little bit and introduce path parameters.
			  
		<h2 id="pathparams">Path parameters</h2>
		From the applications perspective, it is tempting to interpret an URL as a function, a request as a function call, and 
		URL parameters arguments to the function. For example in the following URL the id parameter could specify a database id of
		a customer entity, and the sample request would therefore return a HTML page showing data of customer 1345:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>https://example.org/crm/customers/show.html?id=1345</code></pre>
		</div>
		  
		Contrary to that view the concept of {link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL semantic or clean URLs}
		demands a different style of URL design: URLs identify resources and should not contain technical parameters which are instead 
		expressed in a RESTful way:
		<ul>
		<li>Customer 1345 receives an own URL (which is different from customer 1346), 
			therefore the parameter <code>id</code> is made part of the request path.
		<li>The URL segment <code>/show</code> is dropped. Instead the HTTP method "GET" is used to tell the server that we 
			intend to retrieve readonly information.
		<li>The path extension <code>.html</code> is dropped. Instead the HTTP Accept header is used to request a specific content-type.
		</ul>
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>GET /crm/customers/1345<br>Accept: text/html</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
		Accordingly, updating customer 1346, by sending JSON data, might be done with  
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>PUT /crm/customers/1346<br>Content-Type: application/json</code></pre>
		</div>
		From a functional point of view, path segments like <code>/1345</code> or <code>/1346</code> can transport the same
		information as parameters and can be used for the same purpose (namely identifying application data). 
		We call such segments <b>path parameters</b>. (Please note that path parameters are not a syntax element of URLs but just 
		an interpretation of path segments as parameter values).
		<p>
		Of course, in order to answer such requests, the application will examine path parameter segments, convert them into a value
		(e.g. a customer id) and use them in their calls to the data back-end.
		<p>
		Path parameters enable clean URLs, but internally require more sophisticated mapping of URLs to controller code: 
		With path parameters applications can potentially expose an unlimited number of resource URLs.<br>
		Therefore routing can't just use constant resource paths, but instead needs to map <b>path schemes</b> to controller code:  
		<div class="highlight">
			<table width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><code>/crm/customers/<b>{:customerId [0-9]+}</b></code></td>
				<td width="50%"><code>&rArr; com.crm.customers.id.IndexController</code></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		At runtime the path parameter segments are converted into a path parameter value:
		<div class="highlight">
			<table width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><code>/crm/customers/1345</code></td>
				<td width="50%">run <code>IndexController</code> with <code>customerId = 1345</code></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		In Civilian path parameters are not constrained to a single path segment, but can also span multiple path segments.
		Types of path parameter values can be of any kind, not just Strings or simple types.   
		<div class="highlight">
			<table width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><code>/archive/<b>2014/11/20</b></code></td>
				<td width="50%"><code><b>&equiv; Date(2014,11,20)</b></code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><code>/blog/posts/<b>c3po/latest-musings</b></code></td>
				<td width="50%"><code><b>&equiv; Post(id:"c3po", slug:"latest-musings")</b></code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><code><b>/en</b>/intro</code></td>
				<td width="50%"><code><b>&equiv; Locale.ENGLISH</b></code></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		
		Extracting path parameter values from path strings is only one half of the game. When we want to build resource URLs
		(for instance to be used in HTML hyperlinks) path parameter values need to be formatted and inserted into a path scheme. 
		<p>		
		<hr>
		<p>		
		Civilian takes a very formalized approach in handling path parameters:
		<ul>
		<li>Every path parameter is described by an own {javadoc:resource.PathParam} object.
		<li>A PathParam object knows how to extract its value from one or more path segments and 
			is able to format a value into one or more path segments.
		<li>PathParam implementations exist for most {javadoc:resource.PathParams common use cases}, but you can easily build implementations
			for more specific cases. 
		<li>Defining the URL of a resource includes to describe which path parameters are used in what URL parts.
		<li>When a request is dispatched, and the matching resource is determined, all path parameters are automatically recognized,
			their values extracted and made available via {javadoc:request.Request#getPathParam(org*civilian*resource*PathParam) Request.getPathParam(PathParam)}.<br>
			<small>This method does not take some string to identify the path param, but a PathParam object, therefore enforcing 
			compile time safety.</small> 
		<li>When generating URLs via the {javadoc:resource.Url} class, you simply provide a value for every contained path parameter
			and let the Url class do the formatting.  
		<li>All the path parameters used by an application are defined as application wide constants.
			{javadoc:application.Application} implementations register their path parameters via a {javadoc:resource.PathParamMap} passed to the constructor
			of the application base class.<br>
			For an example please take a look at the source code of the <a href="doc-samples.html#crm">CRM sample</a>:
			<ul>
			<li>{source:org.civilian.samples.crm.web.CrmPathParams} defines constants for all path parameters used by the CRM application
				and collects them in a {javadoc:resource.PathParamMap}
			<li>{source:org.civilian.samples.crm.web.CrmApp} registers the path parameters by passing the map to the application base class,
			<li>{source:org.civilian.samples.crm.web.root.customers.id.CustomerController} uses a PathParam to read the value from a request. 
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
		The resource URLs of an application build a hierarchy or tree. So does a file system, and publishing a directory of static resources as 
		website is easy:
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<th>File</th>
			<th width="40%">maps to URL Path</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>/webapp<b>/index.html</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/index.html</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>/webapp<b>/css/stlyes.css</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/css/styles.css</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3 id="basemapping">Base mapping from controller classes to resource paths</h3>
		Java classes also build a hierarchy and we use this to derive a default mapping from package and class name:   
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<th>Class</th>
			<th width="40%">maps to URL Path</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>com.demo.web.<b>LoginController</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/login</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>com.demo.web.<b>posts.ListController</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/posts/list</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		At application startup Civilian scans the classpath for all controller classes of the application.
		To be recognized as controller, a class
		<ol>
		<li>must have a simple name which ends with <code>Controller</code>
		<li>must (directly or indirectly) be derived from {javadoc:controller.Controller}
		<li>must be in or below the {javadoc:controller.ControllerConfig#getRootPackage() controller root package} which by default equals
			the package of the application class.
		</ol>
		The qualified controller class - minus the root package, dots converted to slashes, uppercase converted to lowercase
		gives the resource path of the controller (relative to the application path). 
		<p>
		One great advantage of this implicit mapping is that you can easily find the controller class given a resource url based
		on the naming conventions. And contrary to explicit routing it can't get out of sync   
		when you rename classes or packages.    

		<h3 id="indexcontrollers">IndexControllers</h3>
		Given the mapping based on package and class names we could not map a controller to the application root <code>/</code>. 
		To enable this, controller classes named <code>IndexController</code> are treated specially, and are mapped to the path corresponding to its package:   
		  
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<td><code>com.demo.web.<b>IndexController</b></code></td>
			<td width="40%"><code>/</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>com.demo.web.<b>posts.IndexController</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/posts</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3 id="pathanno">Using the @Segment annotation on packages and class names</h3>
		When you specify the {javadoc:annotation.Segment @Segment} annotation on a controller class or package (in its 
		<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.4">package-info.java</a>),
		the annotation value then is used to extend the path, instead of the simple class name or the last package part:
		<p>
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<td><code>@Segment("<b>Civilian</b>") package com.demo.web.<b>civ</b></code></td>
			<td width="40%"><code>/Civilian</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>@Segment("<b>temp</b>") public class com.demo.web.<b>civ.TmpController</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/Civilian/temp</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>@Segment("<b>index</b>") public class com.demo.web.<b>civ.IndexController</b></code></td>
			<td><code>/Civilian/index</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		Therefore use the @Segment annotation to override the naming conventions when necessary.<br>
		<small>(Or as an advanced technique alter the {javadoc:controller.ControllerNaming naming conventions}).</small>
		<p>
		Please not that the @Segment value is not interpreted as absolute path (like in JAX-RS) but rather
		extends the path defined by the parent package.  		
		 
		<h3 id="pathparamanno">Using the @PathParam annotation on packages and class names</h3>
		Right now Controllers can only be mapped to constant paths. To map to path schemes which contain
		path parameters, use the {javadoc:annotation.PathParam @PathParam} annotation on packages
		or controller classes.<br>
		The value of the annotation is the {javadoc:resource.PathParam#getName() PathParam name}.
		<p>
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<td><code>@PathParam("<b>userId</b>") package com.demo.web.users.id<</code>/td>
			<td width="40%"><code>/users/{userId:[a-z0-9]+}</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>com.demo.web.users.id.ProfileController</code></td>
			<td width="40%"><code>/users/{userId:[a-z0-9]+}/profile</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<h3 id="segannomethods">Using the @Segment annotation on controller methods</h3>
		Given all these features every dynamic resource exposed by the application still requires an own controller class.
		Nothing wrong with that, but for very small controller implementations this might seem a liitle bit oversized.<br>
		As we will see in the <a href="doc-controllers.html">Controller</a> chapter, controller classes define
		special methods as entry points for request processing.
		<br>
		You can place {javadoc:annotation.Segment @Segment} on such methods and create a virtual sub-controller class
		which processes requests for the corresponding sub-resource: 
		
		<table class="table">
		<tr>
			<td><code>com.demo.web.SearchController</code></td>
			<td width="40%"><code>/search</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>@Segment("filter") com.demo.web.SearchController#processFilter()</code></td>
			<td><code>/search/filter</code></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		So using @Segment annotations on methods you can implements multiple resource URLs in a single controller class.

		<h3 id="exensions">URLs and extensions</h3>
		In all the examples we followed the {link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL clean URL}
		paradigma and did not use any extension in URLs.<br>
		Actually when a resource request is dispatched to a controller, the extension of the URL is simply ignored.
		By default both these requests URLs yield the same result:
		<div class="highlight">
			<pre><code>/users<br>/users.html</code></pre>
		</div>
		   
		<h3 id="finepoints">Fine points of resource mappings</h3>
		No resource may be mapped to more than one controller. 
		Doing so (e.g. using @Segment annotations), results in an error.
		<p>
		<b>Abstract</b> controller classes will not be mapped to a resource.

		<h3 id="checking">Checking resource mappings</h3>
		The <a href="doc-development.html#admin">admin app</a> lists all resources of an application and the associated
		controller classes. This allows for a fast check if the reality matches the intended routing.
